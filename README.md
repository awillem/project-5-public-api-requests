# project-5-public-api-requests
This is the 5th project for the Treehouse FSJS Techdegree.

12 random users information is retrieved from randomuser.me 
and dynamically displayed to the page

The card displayed on the page includes an image, name, email, and location. 
Clicking on the card pulls up a modal card with this info plus phone, detailed 
address and birthday.

This modal card can be closed by clicking on the X, clicking off the modal card, 
or pressing escape. 

** Exceeds Expectation features **
A search field is included dynamically.  Search field works when pressing enter 
or clicking the submit button.  However, it also works as a person types or deletes information.

When the modal card is open, next and previous buttons are included that can cycle 
through the users.  Cycling stops when the first or last user is displayed.

CSS styling has been updated from the original CSS.  
* Fonts were updated, changing to 3 different fonts, one for the headline, one for the name, and one for everything else.
* Text shadow added to header
* Box shadow added to cards
* background color changed to a gradient
* border added around images
